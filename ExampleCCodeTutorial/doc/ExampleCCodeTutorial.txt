/**
 * This project is an example of a tested and mostly documented
 * program.  There are areas of improvement (I wrote over the weekend
 * and not all of it is sober code) but the basic programming guidelines
 * are there.
*/

Requirements:
	Create a program that allows the user to test their parenting skills.  The user should be able to specify the simulated child's age.  Proper research should be done to determine the proper reaction of children to the user's (parent's) demands based on age.  This reaction should then be programmed into the simulated child.

Structure of Tutorial
1.  Come up with Stories for the Project (Backlog)
	a.  "As a user I want to ________"
	b.  INVEST
		Independent
		Negotiable
		Valuable
		Estimable
		Small
		Testable
	b.  Acceptance Criteria: 
		Conditions that must be met for story to be accepted by customer
		Clear Pass or Fail
2.  Inception Planning / Sprint 0
	a.  Work with Steakholders to refine Backlog.
2.  Break Stories into tasks that correspond to the Project. (Each task should take two to four hours)
3.  Estimate the effort needed to complete the first three to four stories.
4.  Repeatedly take tasks from the highest priority Story and begin to code using TDD (Test Driven Development).
	a.  Ensure full Unit, Modular, and System tests are completed. 
5.  Complete a Sprint Review and Retrospective every 1-3 weeks.
